# Stock Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the sentiment of news headlines related to various stocks to provide insights into market sentiment. Using the BeautifulSoup library, news headlines were extracted from HTML pages, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was used to perform sentiment analysis. The objective is to identify sentiment trends that could influence stock performance, offering valuable insights for investors.

## Project Structure
- **Notebook** (`stock_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`): This Jupyter notebook contains the entire workflow, including web scraping, sentiment analysis, and visualization. It covers:
  - **Web Scraping**: Extraction of news headlines from HTML pages using BeautifulSoup, followed by cleaning and preprocessing.
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Each headline is analyzed for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using the NLTK library to capture public perception trends.
  - **Visualization and Insights**: The notebook includes visualizations and summaries to help interpret sentiment trends over time.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis on News Headlines**: Categorizes stock-related headlines as positive, negative, or neutral to gauge market sentiment.
- **Web Scraping**: Automatically retrieves headlines from HTML pages for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual summaries to identify sentiment trends that may influence stock performance.

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Ensure all required libraries are installed (NLTK, BeautifulSoup, etc.).
2. **Run Notebook**: Open `stock_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` to execute the full workflow, from web scraping to sentiment analysis and visualization of results.
3. **Explore Results**: View the notebookâ€™s output to understand sentiment trends and their potential impact on stock performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for scraping and sentiment analysis.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping and HTML parsing.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For processing and analyzing the sentiment of news headlines.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing sentiment trends and insights.

## Summary
This project leverages natural language processing to analyze stock-related news sentiment, providing insights that could benefit investors. By combining web scraping and sentiment analysis in one notebook, this project reveals sentiment trends that may impact stock performance.
